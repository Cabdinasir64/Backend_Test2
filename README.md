# backend_test2

**Learning project:** Node.js + TypeScript + MongoDB

---

## Overview

This repository is a personal **learning project** where I explore and practice building a backend using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**.  
The main goal is to understand how these technologies work together and how to implement **CRUD operations** with **filters** and **data querying**.

Key learning points:

- How **Node.js** handles server-side logic.
- How **TypeScript** adds type safety and improves code maintainability.
- How **MongoDB** stores, retrieves, and filters data efficiently.
- How **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations are implemented.
- How to apply **filters and queries** to retrieve specific data.

## Features

- **User registration with email verification (OTP)**
- **CRUD operations** for users or other resources
- **Filtering and querying** data from MongoDB
- **MongoDB integration using Mongoose**
- **Type-safe TypeScript backend**
- **Error handling and structured API responses**
